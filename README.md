Regular expression highlighting
===============================
Bleeding edge, engine-agnostic highlighting for regular expression data.

If regular expressions were an actual language, this would be its official package.


Planned features
----------------
* Tester to match expressions as they're entered.
* Other commands for copying expressions for different languages (CSON, etc).
